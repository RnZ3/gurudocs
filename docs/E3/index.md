# E3
E3 is a Dex offering zero-slippage trading and capital efficiency through its 'Bucket' model and concentrated liquidity. Eâ…¢ was the first Concentrated Liquidity AMM to adopt the Solidly Model and implement the separation of Trade-Fee rewards from Liquidity Incentives.

It is based on the Trader Joe 2.1 externally but consists of a modified core that helps it generate a slightly better Capital Efficiency.
